0,0,WHat is a community partner?,"[Join as a community partner

BioImage.IO is a community-driven open source initiative, providing access to trained deep learning models and related resources contributed by the community members. To help us better disseminate and maintain the resources, we introduced the concepts of community partner.
What is a community partner?
Usually, a community partner is an organization, a company, a research group, or a software team (of one or more) that can consume and/or produce resources of the BioImage.Io model zoo. Additionally, most partners continuously and openly contribute resources of their own. The first community partners represent open source consumer software of BioImage.IO (e.g. ilastik, Fiji, deepImageJ, ZeroCostDL4Mic, StarDist).]

[Benefits as a community partner
By joining BioImage.IO as a community partner, you will be able to:

Participate in decision making process of the model specification.
Show your logo in BioImage.IO and enable filtering models by compatibility with your software.
Connect CI to automatically test new model compatibility with your software and use other infrastructure features provided by BioImage.IO.
Who should join as a community partner?
A team behind a software which produces or consumes trained models compatible with the BioImage.IO spec.
A organization, group, company or team (of one or more) who contributed and will keep contributing more models to BioImage.IO.]
[How does it work?
Community partners can host their own Github repository for storing models and other resources that are relevant. These resources are listed in a collection RDF–a yaml file–which will be dynamically linked to the central repository of BioImage.IO. The continuous integration (CI) service configured in the central repo will then pull the resources from partners' repo and compile them into items displayed in the BioImage.IO website. Each community partner is responsible for maintaining the resources that are relevant.

As a community partner, you can participate in the decision-making process of the model specification, display your logo on BioImage.IO, and filter models by compatibility with your software. Additionally, you can connect CI to automatically test new model compatibility and use other infrastructure features provided by BioImage.IO.

Community partners have certain responsibilities, including using BioImage.IO as their primary trained model repository, reviewing resources claimed to be compatible with their software, and maintaining their models and resources in a linked repository. They also need to set up continuous integration workflows to test models and keep them updated with the latest specifications.

Organizations or teams that produce or consume trained models compatible with the BioImage.IO spec and those who have contributed and will continue to contribute more models to BioImage.IO should consider joining as community partners.

      BioImage.IO is a community-driven open source initiative, providing access to trained deep learning models and related resources contributed by the community members. To help us better disseminate and maintain the resources, we introduced the concepts of **community partner**. ]

  [How to join as a community partner?
      Note that in order to contribute resources to the BioImage.IO Model Zoo you do not need to become a community partner. How to contribute resources is described [here](/contribute_models/README.md). The role of a community partner is described [here](/community_partners/README.md).
    
      If you are eligible and willing to join as a community partner, please submit a request issue [here](https://github.com/bioimage-io/collection-bioimage-io/issues/new) with relevant information including the following:
      1. Description of your software, organization, company or team.
      2. Description of the resources that you plan to contribute. Please also include the url to your project repo.
      3. Description of future plans on how your project will be maintained.
    
      The admin team of BioImage.IO will discuss the request and decide whether to approve or decline. We will mainly check whether the project are beneficial for the users of BioImage.IO and the requirements for participation are met.
    
      Upon approval, we will guide you to follow these steps in order to incorporate your contribution to BioImage.IO:
    
      1. Firstly, please create or choose a GitHub repo for hosting your resource collection that you would like to contribute. We recommend to create a dedicated repository in your organization for this purpose. As an example you might want to take a look at the [ilastik collection](https://github.com/ilastik/bioimage-io-resources/blob/main/collection.yaml).
      1. Add a [collection RDF](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/collection_spec_latest.md) in your chosen repository, which lists all resources you would like to contribute. For this, you will also need to prepare the icons of your software or project.
      1. Setup CI service for testing your collection RDF. Please refer to [how to setup CI service](/community_partners/how_to_join?id=how-to-setup-ci-service-for-a-community-partners39-repo).
      1. Make a PR (or an issue) in the BioImage.IO Collection repo to link your collection to the [collection_rdf_template.yaml](https://github.com/bioimage-io/collection-bioimage-io/blob/main/collection_rdf_template.yaml)(under `config.partners`). We only require the link to your collection RDF here and need to agree on a partner id for you.
      1. To make the maintainance easier, we also ask you to add one of the admin member as collabrators in your resource collection repository. This will make it easier for us to help you maintaining your collection, and keep synchronized in case we make changes to the specification.
What is a community partner?
      Usually, a community partner is an organization, a company, a research group, or a software team (of one or more) that can consume and/or produce resources of the BioImage.Io model zoo. Additionally, most partners continuously and openly contribute resources of their own. The first community partners represent open source consumer software of BioImage.IO (e.g. ilastik, Fiji, deepImageJ, ZeroCostDL4Mic, StarDist).]

Additionally, most partners continuously and openly contribute resources of their own. The first community partners represent open source consumer software of BioImage.IO (e.g. ilastik, Fiji, deepImageJ, ZeroCostDL4Mic, StarDist).

### Benefits as a community partner
By joining BioImage.IO as a community partner, you will be able to:
 - Participate in decision making process of the model specification.
 - Show your logo in BioImage.IO and enable filtering models by compatibility with your software.
 - Connect CI to automatically test new model compatibility with your software and use other infrastructure features provided by BioImage.IO.
 
### Responsibilities
The main responsibilities of a community partner are:
 - Use BioImage.IO as their only primary trained model repository.
 - Review resources contributed by others that claim to be compatible with this community partner software.
 - Maintain this community partner's models and other resources in their linked repository, setup continous integration workflows to test models and keep them up-to-date with the latest spec.
 
### Who should join as a community partner?
 * A team behind a software which produces or consumes trained models compatible with the BioImage.IO spec.

3,3,How can I segment an image using Fiji?,"[## Introduction

This tutorial is designed to give you a first impression of the segmentation tools available in Fiji. It covers basic thresholding and morphology operations (erode, dilate, open, close), [Level Sets](/plugins/level-sets), the [Simple Neurite Tracer](/plugins/snt) and the [Segmentation Editor](/plugins/segmentation-editor).

Texture segmentation

Not all images which Fiji users are interested in contain bright objects on dark background, or vice versa. Sometimes, the structures cannot be discerned using the intensity, but only using statistic measures where the inside pixels have a different geometric distribution than the outside pixels. Example:

<figure><img src=""/media/tem-clahe-50-256-2.5.jpg"" title=""Tem-clahe-50-256-2.5.jpg"" width=""500"" alt=""Tem-clahe-50-256-2.5.jpg"" /><figcaption aria-hidden=""true"">Tem-clahe-50-256-2.5.jpg</figcaption></figure>

[This proposal is about adding at least one such segmentation algorithm to Fiji.

**Goal:** Add a segmentation algorithm to Fiji which uses texture features to discern different objects from background (and from each other).  
**Language:** Java  
**Mentor:** Johannes Schindelin (johannes.schindelin@gmx.de)]

[Applying machine learning to the image segmentation problem

The term *image segmentation* describes the task where objects in an image are to be outlined, so that every pixel is connected to either a named object, or background.

Segmentation is traditionally a very difficult problem, especially in the presence of variable lighting, noise, or low contrast.

Many segmentation algorithms have been implemented in Fiji to perform image segmentation, such as [Auto Threshold](/plugins/auto-threshold) and [Auto Local Threshold](/plugins/auto-local-threshold), but in practice, none of them might work, as they were designed with specific images in mind, and these expectations might not be met by your images.

Recently, a new class of segmentation algorithms has been emerging: segmentation by example. These algorithms require a set of examples from which a model is calculated which can be applied to other -- similar-looking -- images.

{% include thumbnail src='/media/trakem2-display-s.jpg' title='Segmented neural tissue, painfully done by hand. See the [Public data sets](/plugins/public-data-sets)'%}

We will consider applications for implementations that are either as generic as possible (i.e. they apply to any images), or that try to solve a very specific problem (such as segmenting neurons in serial sections imaged with electron microscopy, or with confocal imaging.)

We have several data sets of images and their corresponding manual segmentations (for training the algorithm). See for example:

-   <i>Drosophila</i> larva brain imaged with ssTEM: [http://t2.ini.uzh.ch/data.html](http://t2.ini.uzh.ch/data.html)
-   <i>Drosophila</i> embryonic nuclei imaged with confocal microscopy.

You are welcome to use any scientifically-relevant dataset of your choice, but we will give priority to biologically-oriented data sets.

A plugin already exists for Fiji: [Trainable Segmentation](/plugins/tws).

**Goal:** Implement a number of segmentation algorithms based on machine learning.  
**Language:** Java.  
**Mentor:** {% include person id='iarganda' %}, {% include person id='acardona' %}, {% include person id='mhl' %}]","To segment an image using Fiji, you can utilize various tools and algorithms available within the software. The tutorial covers fundamental techniques such as basic thresholding, morphology operations (erode, dilate, open, close), Level Sets, Simple Neurite Tracer, and the Segmentation Editor. These tools are effective for images with distinct bright objects on dark backgrounds or vice versa.

Additionally, the proposal suggests adding a texture-based segmentation algorithm to Fiji. The goal is to discern different objects from the background and each other by incorporating texture features. The proposed algorithm, to be implemented in Java, aims to enhance Fiji's segmentation capabilities, especially for images where traditional intensity-based methods may not be sufficient.

Moreover, the text introduces the application of machine learning to image segmentation in Fiji. This involves the use of segmentation algorithms based on machine learning, particularly segmentation by example. These algorithms require a set of examples to train a model, which can then be applied to similar-looking images. The text provides links to biologically-oriented datasets for training purposes. There is also mention of an existing Fiji plugin, Trainable Segmentation, which can be used for machine learning-based segmentation.

In summary, image segmentation in Fiji involves a range of tools, including basic operations, texture-based algorithms, and machine learning-based approaches. The choice of method depends on the characteristics of the images and the specific segmentation requirements.",,imagej.net,"To segment an image using Fiji, you can follow these general steps:

1. Open your image in Fiji by dragging and dropping the image file into the Fiji window or by using the ""File"" > ""Open"" option.

2. Once the image is open, go to the ""Plugins"" menu and select ""Segmentation"" to see the available segmentation tools. You can also use the ""Image"" menu and select ""Type"" to convert the image to the desired type for segmentation.

3. Choose the segmentation method that best suits your image. Fiji offers various segmentation plugins and tools such as thresholding, watershed segmentation, and more. You can explore these options based on the characteristics of your image.

4. After applying the segmentation method, you can further refine the segmented regions using tools such as ""Wand Tool"" for manual selection, or other plugins available under the ""Plugins"" menu.

5. Once you are satisfied with the segmentation, you can save the segmented image using the ""File"" > ""Save As"" option.

Remember that the specific steps may vary based on the type of image and the segmentation method you choose, but these general steps should help you get started with segmenting an image using Fiji.","Hello! It looks like you're interested in learning how to segment images using Fiji. Here's a brief guide to get you started with some of the segmentation tools available in Fiji:

1. **Basic Thresholding and Morphology Operations**: You can start with basic thresholding methods and morphology operations such as erode, dilate, open, and close. These are fundamental techniques for segmenting objects in an image.

2. **Level Sets**: Explore the [Level Sets plugin](https://imagej.net/plugins/level-sets) for more advanced segmentation, which is particularly useful for tracking moving objects in a sequence of images.

3. **Simple Neurite Tracer**: If you're working with neuronal structures, the [Simple Neurite Tracer plugin](https://imagej.net/plugins/snt) can help you trace and analyze neurites in image stacks.

4. **Segmentation Editor**: For interactive segmentation and editing, you can use the [Segmentation Editor plugin](https://imagej.net/plugins/segmentation-editor).

For images where intensity-based methods are not sufficient, you might want to look into texture segmentation algorithms. Fiji is considering adding such algorithms that use texture features to discern different objects from the background.

Additionally, if you're dealing with variable lighting, noise, or low contrast, machine learning-based segmentation might be the way to go. The [Trainable Segmentation plugin](https://imagej.net/plugins/tws) allows you to train a model with examples and apply it to similar-looking images.

I hope this helps you get started with image segmentation in Fiji! If you have any more specific questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.
